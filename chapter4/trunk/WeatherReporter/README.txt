Unlocking Android - WeatherReporter
------------------------------------
Android code example that makes use of many Android features.
This project has several Activity classes that allow 
a user to specify criteria and then view weather reports. 

Weather reports are obtained over the network from the Yahoo! 
Weather API. Weather alerts can also be enabled and are 
sent via a background Service that queries an SQLite database. 

UI, Notifications, Networking, Data, XML parsing, background Services, threads, etc. 
- are all a part of this application.
